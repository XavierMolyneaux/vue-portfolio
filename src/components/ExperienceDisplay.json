            "Before pulseM could be acquired, I was tasked with creating more granular Access Control logic to protect client accounts, ultimately to comply with HIPAA. From the highest management level to the lowest technical detail, a key piece was understanding the acquiring company’s expectations/standards in relation to our legacy system during planning, implementation and testing phases.",
            "pulseM not only focused on reputation management for its clients, but also their employee retention rates. We attempted to combat the industry issue with our Employee Rewards product, but I noticed the internal issues it was creating. I tasked myself with optimizing the technology and processes used to keep it running, ultimately reducing memory usage and manual overhead for the upsell product that distributed $20k+ rewards monthly.",
            "Contributing to SiteSudo from 2018 to 2020 as a web developer and digital marketer, staying updated with industry standards and the clients’ requirements was crucial. Understanding this, I helped shape the SaaS platform many local/national Waste Management and Event Rental businesses trusted to propel them towards their goals."
